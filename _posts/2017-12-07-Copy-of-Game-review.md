  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered during this task by trying to find the all the variables in this game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Is this a variable?         How many variables are in this game?
Does this barrel count as a sprite?       What does variable mean?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>It was hard when you are not independent but when you are alone you  can easily think to yourself and come up with answers without people telling you the answers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>As I reflect I think about all the sprites and variables each game requires to enable it to become a good game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td> I think I engaged with the task really well when i did this task as it got me thinking more deeply about everything not just as a simple based structure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in my learning is that I could have written my work in a more structured way instead putting it together in weird bits and pieces.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I should do better in my learning next time is to plan my structure of my work instead of just arriving with a mess of the work and I should try to push myself to get a higher expected standard of work completed on time.</td>
