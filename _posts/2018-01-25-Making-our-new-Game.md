    <td>Starting point:</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make sure that when pressed play it broadcasts to my game to begin.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere every time I hit a dead end and I had to find new methods to do what i wanted my code to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>How can the sprite, play, make sure that it can broadcast the game to play?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked by myself occasionally asking where a piece of code was.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After reflecting I believe that I should believe in myself and it can be fun to get things wrong but I have to learn from it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I believe that I had engaged with my work and attempted to do my code when I didn't believe in myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning what could have gone better is that I work entirely on my own and not plead for help as nobody will always be there to correct my mistake and to tell me what to do. I have to go through all my code in my head and see my improvement.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I could change in my learning is that I go through things in my head and not be persistence for help like I said. Also I have to have more belief in myself. As I don't believe in myself the problem of asking why will increase.</td>
