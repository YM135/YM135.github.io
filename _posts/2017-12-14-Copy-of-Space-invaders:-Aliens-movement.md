    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I forgot my password so I set my whole scratch account up again with another account. I tried to remember the steps of the coding of the ship, boss and laser. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>What did the spaceship do to move left and right?
Did the boss-ship have any variables, if so what were they?</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to find most of my own code by myself and if I needed lots of help I would ask my older cousin or my friend.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>By reflecting on this topic I have realised that finding the answers for my code has helped me to gain a bit of confidence on searching for answer and not just relying that there will be the answer right in front of me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I think I could have engaged in the lesson a bit more when Mr Keen was asking questions instead of listening to the answers and not engaging like my classmates did.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better is that if I tried to think of more solutions and not just getting stuck on one idea and thinking about it all the time.</td>
