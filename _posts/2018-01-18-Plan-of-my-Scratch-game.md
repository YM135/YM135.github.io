**Year 7 Scratch Project Handbook**

By half term, you will have created your own game using Scratch. (don't worry, you can do it!)

It can be any sort of game you like. Your research should have given you a range of ideas and possibilities. 

Working through this handbook will take you to your solution!

**Step 1 **

Planning

* What is your game about?

* How will you win/lose or start/end the game?

* What needs to be in your game? 

**Step 2**

Designing

* What sprites will you need?

* What resources will you need? 

* What variables/broadcasts/custom blocks?

**Step 3**

Building

* This is the longest stage and will comprise several weeks and homeworks. 

**Step 4 **

Evaluating

* Have you achieved what you designed? 

* Test your game and the games of others.

**Step 5 **

Improving

* Once you receive feedback, what are you doing to do? 

* Make your game better. 

Step 1: Planning

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What is your game about? Name it. Describe the gameplay/how it is played. What is the purpose of the game?
Add a description below to tell me about your game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The game is going to a multiplayer racing game. The concept is that there are two cars on the race track and you have to try get the  most gems within a limited time. The background screen is going to move around so maybe the code for it may have to be on a forever loop until the time is finished. 
</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How will your game be won or lost? 
Make sure you add details here. Be precise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My game will be won won where the person with the most gems( the ones you collect) hasit at the end of the timing.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What elements need to be in your game? 
Describe/list what might need to be in your game: A fisherman that is trying to hook fish; the basket to land them in, etc. This part needs plenty of detail. Be thorough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cars racing only left and right, snowballs coming to hit them, gems, a snowy race track that only allows the racers to go on the road.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Project Checklist**

**Originality**

Is your project original or a remake of another project?

It is a runner game so the game is obviously quite similar to many games but there will be a different twist that will make it original.

**Creativity**

Is your project creative and is it different and unique?

It is a unique game in the sense that it is based in the mountains instead of elsewhere.

**Backgrounds**

Do the backgrounds/stage add to and enhance the product?

The background will show what the game is and add to the product. It will hopefully invite more people to play the game.

 

**Sprites**

Do the sprites/costumes you chose add to and enhance the product?

The monster sprites will make the game much harder and more exciting. The old wizard will explain what the game is about.

 

**Scripts**

Do the Scripts make the sprites effectively do what you want them to do? Do you have correct x y coordinates? Do you include "forevers" where needed, etc.

Yes the scripts will make sense. I will think twice before I code.

 

**Purpose**

Is the purpose of the product evident to the audience?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard. There will be a tutorial

 

**User-Friendly**

Is the product user friendly? Did you include notes to help the user know how to manipulate the product?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard.

Step 2: Designing

What Sprites will you need? Describe the Sprite and detail what it will do.
